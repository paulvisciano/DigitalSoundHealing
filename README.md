Music is love and brings the inner creative out of everyone. 

This project aims to create a low barrier of entry way to play sound healing instruments digitally, allowing everyone to be a creative. 

Many hours were spent researching the connection between the stars, chakras, colors, shapes, music theory, sound healing, emotions and more to digest and bring it all together into an easy to use User Interface, allowing YOU the creator to not worry about the complexity and just enjoy creating.
